# OIR-Python-Code

Repository for python code written by WC OIR interns. 
Upload only general scripts that may be modified for other
uses, and obviously don't upload anything that could
be confidential.

Projects should be added as sub-folders within the repository
and their general purposes should be documented in this README.

Projects:

1. **cohortanalysis** was used originally used to assist in merging separate 
surveys sent to the same group of students over the course of four years.  
Typical workflow: Take a bunch of files that map emails (or some other
variable that is unique to every student in the school) to reponse id's
that are unique with in a given file.  Make sure they are in csv form
(you can use the helper methods in utils to do this or add your own). 
Put all these csv files in a directory, and make sure they are in the 
same format (e.g. col 0 is universal id; col 1 is response id). 
Run the findcohort script. Run the organizeresults script from
utils.py on the output, and then run mergesyntax on the output of 
that. (Future task: Put all of these methods into one easy to use 
program :) )

2. **tutorvisitsanalysis** is a script that looks tutor data, extracts
information to answer preliminary research questions, and creates 
graphics accordingly.  Also saves results of some research questions
to CSV files. 

3. **analyzecomments** contains scripts to analyze open ended responses / 
comments that might be part of a survey. 
analyzecomments.py takes in a csv file, where each row is a comment, and writes
a table to a new csv file where each row is a comment, each column is a word of type 
POS indicated by an argument, and the cells are a boolean (1, 0) indicating 1: the
word appears in the comment, or 0: the word does not appear in the  comment.  Only 
words that appear in > threshold number of comments are included.
Note that to run this you have to have the nltk package installed on your
machine.

3. **commentclusters** contains scripts to analyze open ended responses 
comments that might be part of a survey, and can be run independent of and 
as a complement to analyzecomments.
commentclusters.py given an excel file, with a specified column name which's 
rows are comments, creates a json file containing the lists of top words in the cluster, in ranked order.
catvalues.py given an excel file with with a specified column name which's
 rows are comments, 
a json file containing the lists of top words in clusters in ranked orders,
adds a value for the relationship between cluster and comment, for every cluster 
and comment.

4. **oirmail** contains a file oirmail.py. Running _python oirmail.py_ prompts
the user to enter the name of a mailbox label in their gmail mailbox.  First
time users will first be prompted to login and authenticate the app. The 
script processes all previously un-processed messages in the mailbox label
by extracting information about the sender, other mailbox labels, date of email, a
snippet from the email, etc. and saving this information as a row in a .csv file.
Future work includes doing analysis on this .csv file to gain information --
for example, about the efficiency of response times or the types of OIR requests
we get via email.
